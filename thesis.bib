	abstract = {The ability to form and recognize object categories is fundamental to human intelligence. This paper proposes a behavior-grounded relational classification model that allows a robot to recognize the categories of household objects. In the proposed approach, the robot initially explores the objects by applying five exploratory behaviors (lift, shake, drop, crush and push) on them while recording the proprioceptive and auditory sensory feedback produced by each interaction. The sensorimotor data is used to estimate multiple measures of similarity between the objects, each corresponding to a specific coupling between an exploratory behavior and a sensory modality. A graph-based recognition model is trained by extracting features from the estimated similarity relations, allowing the robot to recognize the category memberships of a novel object based on the object's similarity to the set of familiar objects. The framework was evaluated on an upper-torso humanoid robot with two large sets of household objects. The results show that the robot's model is able to recognize complex object categories (e.g., metal objects, empty bottles, etc.) significantly better than chance.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

	abstract = {Human beings can perceive object properties such as size, weight, and material type based solely on the sounds that the objects make when an action is performed on them. In order to be successful, the household robots of the near future must also be capable of learning and reasoning about the acoustic properties of everyday objects. Such an ability would allow a robot to detect and classify various interactions with objects that occur outside of the robot's field of view. This paper presents a framework that allows a robot to infer the object and the type of behavioral interaction performed with it from the sounds generated by the object during the interaction. The framework is evaluated on a 7-d.o.f. Barrett WAM robot which performs grasping, shaking, dropping, pushing and tapping behaviors on 36 different household objects. The results show that the robot can learn models that can be used to recognize objects (and behaviors performed on objects) from the sounds generated during the interaction. In addition, the robot can use the learned models to estimate the similarity between two objects in terms of their acoustic properties.},

	abstract = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development.

The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match.

Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

Moreover, capturing the concepts of places and people is also necessary to enable the robot to gain real-world understanding. In this study, we propose multi-layered multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (mMLDA) to realize the formation of various concepts, and the integration of those concepts, by robots. Because concept formation and integration can be conducted by mMLDA, the formation of each concept affects others, resulting in a more appropriate formation. Another issue to be addressed in this paper is the language acquisition by the robots. We propose a method to infer which words are originally connected to a concept using mutual information between words and concepts. Moreover, the order of concepts in teaching utterances can be learned using a simple Markov model, which corresponds to grammar. This grammar can be used to generate sentences that represent the observed information. We report the results of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel approach for detecting interest points invariant to scale and affine transformations. Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix. Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point. We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points.},

Compared to standard Latent Semantic Analysis which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed method is based on a mixture decomposition derived from a latent class model. This results in a more principled approach which has a solid foundation in statistics. In order to avoid overfitting, we propose a widely applicable generalization of maximum likelihood model fitting by tempered EM.

In this paper, several comparison experiments are done to find a best implementation. The traditional MFCC calculation excludes the 0th coefficient for the reason that it is regarded as somewhat unreliable. According to the analysis and experiments, the authors find that it can be regarded as the generalized frequency band energy (FBE) and is hence useful, which results in the FBE-MFCC. The authors also propose a better analysis, namely the auto-regressive analysis, on the frame energy, which outperform its 1st and/or 2nd order differential derivatives. Experiments with the â863â Speech Database show that, compared with the traditional MFCC with its corresponding auto-regressive analysis coefficients, the FBE-MFCC and the frame energy with their corresponding auto-regressive analysis coefficients form the best combination, reducing the Chinese syllable error rate (CSER) by about 10\%, while the FBE-MFCC with the corresponding auto-regressive analysis coefficients reduces CSER by 2.5\%. Comparison experiments are also done with a quite casual Chinese speech database, named Chinese Annotated Spontaneous Speech (CASS) corpus. The FBE-MFCC can reduce the error rate by about 2.9\% on an average.},

	abstract = {Recent work has shown that people routinely use perceptual information during language comprehension and conceptual processing, from single-word recognition to modality-switching costs in property verification. In investigating such links between perceptual and conceptual representations, the use of modality-specific stimuli plays a central role. To aid researchers working in this area, we provide a set of norms for 423 adjectives, each describing an object property, with mean ratings of how strongly that property is experienced through each of five perceptual modalities (visual, haptic, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory). The data set also contains estimates of modality exclusivityâthat is, a measure of the extent to which a particular property may be considered unimodal (i.e., perceived through one sense alone). Although there already exists a number of sets of word and object norms, we provide the first set to categorize words describing object properties along the dimensions of the five perceptual modalities. We hope that the norms will be of use to researchers working at the interface between linguistic, conceptual, and perceptual systems. The modality exclusivity norms may be downloaded as supplemental materials for this article from brm.psychonomic-journals.org/ content/supplemental.},

	abstract = {The acquisition of object categories which underlie the human lexicon is a prerequisite for domestic robots to communicate with users in a human-like manner. The theory of J. J. Gibson inspires the approach to obtain shared categories through interaction with the shared environment, where explorative behaviors of infants play the role of obtaining distinctive features of objects to shape their categories. Although several existing studies have reproduced the exploratory behaviors of infants by robots to investigate their roles in acquiring such categories, those active categorization methods utilized static touches and the recognition tended to fail by changes of contact conditions. This paper introduces another possible approach to object categorization â object category acquisition by dynamic touch. Dynamic touch (e.g., shaking) provides the agent with the information of the whole object to enable quick and robust recognition. The amplitude spectrum of auditory data which humans obtain during shaking is found to be an effective feature for identifying the object categories of differing dynamics, e.g., rigid objects, paper materials and bottles of water, even though the objects within each category vary in size, shape, amount and contact conditions. Experimental results are given to show the validity of the proposed method and future issues are discussed.},

	abstract = {With the exponential growth in the production creation of multimedia data, there is an increasing need for video semantic analysis. Audio, as a significant part of video, provides important cues to human perception when humans are browsing and understanding video contents. To detect semantic content by useful audio information, we introduce audio keywords which are sets of specific audio sounds related to semantic events. In our previous work, we designed a hierarchical Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for audio keyword identification. However, a weakness of our previous work is that audio signals are artificially segmented into 20 ms frames for frame-based SVM identification without any contextual information. In this paper, we propose a classification method based on Hidden Markov Modal (HMM) for audio keyword identification as an improved work instead of using hierarchical SVM classifier. Choosing HMM is motivated by the successful story of HMM in speech recognition. Unlike the frame-based SVM classification followed by major voting, our proposed HMM-based classifiers treat specific sound as a continuous time series data and employ hidden states transition to capture context information. In particular, we study how to find an effective HMM, i.e., determining topology, observation vectors and statistical parameters of HMM. We also compare different HMM structures with different hidden states, and adjust time series data with variable length. Experimental data includes 40 minutes basketball au-dio which comes from real-time sports games. Experimental results show that, for audio keyword generation, the proposed HMM-based method outperforms the previous hierarchical SVM.},

	abstract = {This tutorial provides an overview of the basic theory of hidden Markov models (HMMs) as originated by L.E. Baum and T. Petrie (1966) and gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory along with a description of selected applications of the theory to distinct problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described},

	abstract = {Several parametric representations of the acoustic signal were compared with regard to word recognition performance in a syllable-oriented continuous speech recognition system. The vocabulary included many phonetically similar monosyllabic words, therefore the emphasis was on the ability to retain phonetically significant acoustic information in the face of syntactic and duration variations. For each parameter set (based on a mel-frequency cepstrum, a linear frequency cepstrum, a linear prediction cepstrum, a linear prediction spectrum, or a set of reflection coefficients), word templates were generated using an efficient dynamic warping method, and test data were time registered with the templates. A set of ten mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients computed every 6.4 ms resulted in the best performance, namely 96.5 percent and 95.0 percent recognition with each of two speakers. The superior performance of the mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients may be attributed to the fact that they better represent the perceptually relevant aspects of the short-term speech spectrum.},

	abstract = {The idea of the log spectrum or cepstral averaging has been useful in many applications such as audio processing, speech processing, speech recognition, and echo detection for the estimation and compensation of convolutional distortions. To suggest what prompted the invention of the term cepstrum, this article narrates the historical and mathematical background that led to its discovery. The computations of earlier simple echo representations have shown that the spectrum representation domain results does not belong in the frequency or time domain. Bogert et al. (1963) chose to refer to it as quefrency domain and later termed the spectrum of the log of a time waveform as the cepstrum. The article also recounts the analysis of Al Oppenheim in relation to the cepstrum. It was in his theory for nonlinear signal processing, referred to as homomorphic systems, that the realization of the characteristic system of homomorphic convolution was reminiscent of the cepstrum. To retain both the relationship to the work of Bogart et al. and the distinction, the term power cepstrum was eventually applied to the nonlinear mapping in homomorphic deconvolution . While most of the terms in the glossary have faded into the background, the term cepstrum has survived and has become part of the digital signal processing lexicon.},

	abstract = {A subjective scale for the measurement of pitch was constructed from determinations of the halfâvalue of pitches at various frequencies. This scale differs from both the musical scale and the frequency scale, neither of which is subjective. Five observers fractionated tones of 10 different frequencies at a loudness level of 60 db. From these fractionations a numerical scale was constructed which is proportional to the perceived magnitude of subjective pitch. In numbering the scale the 1000âcycle tone was assigned the pitch of 1000 subjective units (mels). The close agreement of the pitchscale with an integration of the differential thresholds (DL\&apos;s) shows that, unlike the DL\&apos;s for loudness, all DL\&apos;s for pitch are of uniform subjective magnitude. The agreement further implies that pitch and differential sensitivity to pitch are both rectilinear functions of extent on the basilar membrane. The correspondence of the pitchscale and the experimentally determined location of the resonant areas of the basilar membrane suggests that, in cutting a pitch in half, the observer adjusts the tone until it stimulates a position halfâway from the original locus to the apical end of the membrane. Measurement of the subjective size of musical intervals (such as octaves) in terms of the pitchscale shows that the intervals become larger as the frequency of the midâpoint of the interval increases (except in the two highest audible octaves). This result confirms earlier judgments as to the relative size of octaves in different parts of the frequency range.},
