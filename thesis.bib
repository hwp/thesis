	abstract = {The ability to form and recognize object categories is fundamental to human intelligence. This paper proposes a behavior-grounded relational classification model that allows a robot to recognize the categories of household objects. In the proposed approach, the robot initially explores the objects by applying five exploratory behaviors (lift, shake, drop, crush and push) on them while recording the proprioceptive and auditory sensory feedback produced by each interaction. The sensorimotor data is used to estimate multiple measures of similarity between the objects, each corresponding to a specific coupling between an exploratory behavior and a sensory modality. A graph-based recognition model is trained by extracting features from the estimated similarity relations, allowing the robot to recognize the category memberships of a novel object based on the object's similarity to the set of familiar objects. The framework was evaluated on an upper-torso humanoid robot with two large sets of household objects. The results show that the robot's model is able to recognize complex object categories (e.g., metal objects, empty bottles, etc.) significantly better than chance.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

	abstract = {Human beings can perceive object properties such as size, weight, and material type based solely on the sounds that the objects make when an action is performed on them. In order to be successful, the household robots of the near future must also be capable of learning and reasoning about the acoustic properties of everyday objects. Such an ability would allow a robot to detect and classify various interactions with objects that occur outside of the robot's field of view. This paper presents a framework that allows a robot to infer the object and the type of behavioral interaction performed with it from the sounds generated by the object during the interaction. The framework is evaluated on a 7-d.o.f. Barrett WAM robot which performs grasping, shaking, dropping, pushing and tapping behaviors on 36 different household objects. The results show that the robot can learn models that can be used to recognize objects (and behaviors performed on objects) from the sounds generated during the interaction. In addition, the robot can use the learned models to estimate the similarity between two objects in terms of their acoustic properties.},

	abstract = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development.

The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match.

Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

Moreover, capturing the concepts of places and people is also necessary to enable the robot to gain real-world understanding. In this study, we propose multi-layered multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (mMLDA) to realize the formation of various concepts, and the integration of those concepts, by robots. Because concept formation and integration can be conducted by mMLDA, the formation of each concept affects others, resulting in a more appropriate formation. Another issue to be addressed in this paper is the language acquisition by the robots. We propose a method to infer which words are originally connected to a concept using mutual information between words and concepts. Moreover, the order of concepts in teaching utterances can be learned using a simple Markov model, which corresponds to grammar. This grammar can be used to generate sentences that represent the observed information. We report the results of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel approach for detecting interest points invariant to scale and affine transformations. Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix. Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point. We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points.},

Compared to standard Latent Semantic Analysis which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed method is based on a mixture decomposition derived from a latent class model. This results in a more principled approach which has a solid foundation in statistics. In order to avoid overfitting, we propose a widely applicable generalization of maximum likelihood model fitting by tempered EM.

In this paper, several comparison experiments are done to find a best implementation. The traditional MFCC calculation excludes the 0th coefficient for the reason that it is regarded as somewhat unreliable. According to the analysis and experiments, the authors find that it can be regarded as the generalized frequency band energy (FBE) and is hence useful, which results in the FBE-MFCC. The authors also propose a better analysis, namely the auto-regressive analysis, on the frame energy, which outperform its 1st and/or 2nd order differential derivatives. Experiments with the â863â Speech Database show that, compared with the traditional MFCC with its corresponding auto-regressive analysis coefficients, the FBE-MFCC and the frame energy with their corresponding auto-regressive analysis coefficients form the best combination, reducing the Chinese syllable error rate (CSER) by about 10\%, while the FBE-MFCC with the corresponding auto-regressive analysis coefficients reduces CSER by 2.5\%. Comparison experiments are also done with a quite casual Chinese speech database, named Chinese Annotated Spontaneous Speech (CASS) corpus. The FBE-MFCC can reduce the error rate by about 2.9\% on an average.},

	abstract = {Recent work has shown that people routinely use perceptual information during language comprehension and conceptual processing, from single-word recognition to modality-switching costs in property verification. In investigating such links between perceptual and conceptual representations, the use of modality-specific stimuli plays a central role. To aid researchers working in this area, we provide a set of norms for 423 adjectives, each describing an object property, with mean ratings of how strongly that property is experienced through each of five perceptual modalities (visual, haptic, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory). The data set also contains estimates of modality exclusivityâthat is, a measure of the extent to which a particular property may be considered unimodal (i.e., perceived through one sense alone). Although there already exists a number of sets of word and object norms, we provide the first set to categorize words describing object properties along the dimensions of the five perceptual modalities. We hope that the norms will be of use to researchers working at the interface between linguistic, conceptual, and perceptual systems. The modality exclusivity norms may be downloaded as supplemental materials for this article from brm.psychonomic-journals.org/ content/supplemental.},

	abstract = {The acquisition of object categories which underlie the human lexicon is a prerequisite for domestic robots to communicate with users in a human-like manner. The theory of J. J. Gibson inspires the approach to obtain shared categories through interaction with the shared environment, where explorative behaviors of infants play the role of obtaining distinctive features of objects to shape their categories. Although several existing studies have reproduced the exploratory behaviors of infants by robots to investigate their roles in acquiring such categories, those active categorization methods utilized static touches and the recognition tended to fail by changes of contact conditions. This paper introduces another possible approach to object categorization â object category acquisition by dynamic touch. Dynamic touch (e.g., shaking) provides the agent with the information of the whole object to enable quick and robust recognition. The amplitude spectrum of auditory data which humans obtain during shaking is found to be an effective feature for identifying the object categories of differing dynamics, e.g., rigid objects, paper materials and bottles of water, even though the objects within each category vary in size, shape, amount and contact conditions. Experimental results are given to show the validity of the proposed method and future issues are discussed.},

	abstract = {With the exponential growth in the production creation of multimedia data, there is an increasing need for video semantic analysis. Audio, as a significant part of video, provides important cues to human perception when humans are browsing and understanding video contents. To detect semantic content by useful audio information, we introduce audio keywords which are sets of specific audio sounds related to semantic events. In our previous work, we designed a hierarchical Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for audio keyword identification. However, a weakness of our previous work is that audio signals are artificially segmented into 20 ms frames for frame-based SVM identification without any contextual information. In this paper, we propose a classification method based on Hidden Markov Modal (HMM) for audio keyword identification as an improved work instead of using hierarchical SVM classifier. Choosing HMM is motivated by the successful story of HMM in speech recognition. Unlike the frame-based SVM classification followed by major voting, our proposed HMM-based classifiers treat specific sound as a continuous time series data and employ hidden states transition to capture context information. In particular, we study how to find an effective HMM, i.e., determining topology, observation vectors and statistical parameters of HMM. We also compare different HMM structures with different hidden states, and adjust time series data with variable length. Experimental data includes 40 minutes basketball au-dio which comes from real-time sports games. Experimental results show that, for audio keyword generation, the proposed HMM-based method outperforms the previous hierarchical SVM.},

Petrie (1966) and gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory along with a description of selected applications of the theory to distinct problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described},

The vocabulary included many phonetically similar monosyllabic words, therefore the emphasis was on the ability to retain phonetically significant acoustic information in the face of syntactic and duration variations. For each parameter set (based on a mel-frequency cepstrum, a linear frequency cepstrum, a linear prediction cepstrum, a linear prediction spectrum, or a set of reflection coefficients), word templates were generated using an efficient dynamic warping method, and test data were time registered with the templates. A set of ten mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients computed every 6.4 ms resulted in the best performance, namely 96.5 percent and 95.0 percent recognition with each of two speakers. The superior performance of the mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients may be attributed to the fact that they better represent the perceptually relevant aspects of the short-term speech spectrum.},

The computations of earlier simple echo representations have shown that the spectrum representation domain results does not belong in the frequency or time domain. Bogert et al. (1963) chose to refer to it as quefrency domain and later termed the spectrum of the log of a time waveform as the cepstrum. The article also recounts the analysis of Al Oppenheim in relation to the cepstrum. It was in his theory for nonlinear signal processing, referred to as homomorphic systems, that the realization of the characteristic system of homomorphic convolution was reminiscent of the cepstrum. To retain both the relationship to the work of Bogart et al. and the distinction, the term power cepstrum was eventually applied to the nonlinear mapping in homomorphic deconvolution . While most of the terms in the glossary have faded into the background, the term cepstrum has survived and has become part of the digital signal processing lexicon.},

	abstract = {A subjective scale for the measurement of pitch was constructed from determinations of the halfâvalue of pitches at various frequencies. This scale differs from both the musical scale and the frequency scale, neither of which is subjective. Five observers fractionated tones of 10 different frequencies at a loudness level of 60 db. From these fractionations a numerical scale was constructed which is proportional to the perceived magnitude of subjective pitch. In numbering the scale the 1000âcycle tone was assigned the pitch of 1000 subjective units (mels). The close agreement of the pitchscale with an integration of the differential thresholds (DL\&apos;s) shows that, unlike the DL\&apos;s for loudness, all DL\&apos;s for pitch are of uniform subjective magnitude. The agreement further implies that pitch and differential sensitivity to pitch are both rectilinear functions of extent on the basilar membrane. The correspondence of the pitchscale and the experimentally determined location of the resonant areas of the basilar membrane suggests that, in cutting a pitch in half, the observer adjusts the tone until it stimulates a position halfâway from the original locus to the apical end of the membrane. Measurement of the subjective size of musical intervals (such as octaves) in terms of the pitchscale shows that the intervals become larger as the frequency of the midâpoint of the interval increases (except in the two highest audible octaves). This result confirms earlier judgments as to the relative size of octaves in different parts of the frequency range.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for detecting affine invariant interest points. Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point location as well as in the scale and the shape of the neighbourhood of an interest point. Our approach allows to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based on three key ideas: 1) The second moment matrix computed in a point can be used to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch). 2) The scale of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over scale. 3) An affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest points. A multi-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative algorithm then modifies location, scale and neighbourhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. For matching and recognition, the image is characterized by a set of affine invariant points; the affine transformation associated with each point allows the computation of an affine invariant descriptor which is also invariant to affine illumination changes. A quantitative comparison of our detector with existing ones shows a significant improvement in the presence of large affine deformations. Experimental results for wide baseline matching show an excellent performance in the presence of large perspective transformations including significant scale changes. Results for recognition are very good for a database with more than 5000 images.},

	abstract = {The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of Î³-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure. Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation. In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments.},

	abstract = {The wide-baseline stereo problem, i.e. the problem of establishing correspondences between a pair of images taken from different viewpoints is studied.

A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under (1) continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and (2) monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER).

A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences.

The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5Ã), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion, locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained.},

SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster.

This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps.

The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURFâs application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURFâs usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision.},

The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D.

We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best.

	abstract = {We examined the generally held belief that the postural control system is able to re-weight its available sensory inputs in order to optimize stance control in altered sensory environments. Our view is that previous accounts of sensory re-weighting provide only indirect evidence, which is subject to alternative explanations. The present results provide strong evidence for sensory re-weighting as the primary mechanism for changes observed in postural sway between conditions. Subjects were presented with small-amplitude, oscillatory visual and somatosensory stimuli at 0.20 and 0.28 Hz, respectively, in five conditions that manipulated the amplitudes of stimulus motion. Gain calculated in each trial with respect to each of the two stimuli was found to change systematically as stimulus motion amplitudes changed across condition. The observed pattern of gain rules out a constant-weight, linear account of posture and is consistent with the re-weighting hypothesis. Parameter fits of a third-order, linear stochastic model to postural sway trajectories in each condition showed that changes in gain across condition were primarily due to changes in coupling coefficients rather than changes in parameters that characterize the stability of the postural system. Visual gain was found to depend upon visual motion amplitude and touch gain was found to depend upon touch motion amplitude, indicating intra-modality dependencies. Visual gain also depended upon touch motion amplitude, indicating an inter-modality dependence. To our knowledge, simultaneous re-weighting of more than one sensory input has never been rigorously demonstrated. These techniques may be able to resolve the source of balance control deficits across populations with far more certainty than currently possible.},

Conflicting results and interpretations have contributed to a conceptual gap between psychophysical and physiological accounts of cue integration, but recent studies of visualâvestibular cue integration have narrowed this gap considerably.

	abstract = {Understanding the conditions under which the brain integrates the different sensory streams and the mechanisms supporting this phenomenon is now a question at the forefront of neuroscience. In this paper, we discuss the opportunities for investigating these multisensory processes using modern imaging techniques, the nature of the information obtainable from each method and their benefits and limitations. Despite considerable variability in terms of paradigm design and analysis, some consistent findings are beginning to emerge. The detection of brain activity in human neuroimaging studies that resembles multisensory integration responses at the cellular level in other species, suggests similar crossmodal binding mechanisms may be operational in the human brain. These mechanisms appear to be distributed across distinct neuronal networks that vary depending on the nature of the shared information between different sensory cues. For example, differing extents of correspondence in time, space or content seem to reliably bias the involvement of different integrative networks which code for these cues. A combination of data obtained from haemodynamic and electromagnetic methods, which offer high spatial or temporal resolution respectively, are providing converging evidence of multisensory interactions at both âearlyâ and âlateâ stages of processingââsuggesting a cascade of synergistic processes operating in parallel at different levels of the cortex.},

These sensory modalities use widely different frames of reference to represent the properties and locations of object. Moreover, multisensory cues come with different degrees of reliability, and the reliability of a given cue can change in different contexts. The Bayesian frameworkââwhich we describe in this reviewââprovides an optimal solution to deal with this issue of combining cues that are not equally reliable. However, this approach does not address the issue of frames of references. We show that this problem can be solved by creating cross-modal spatial links in basis function networks. Finally, we show how the basis function approach can be combined with the Bayesian framework to yield networks that can perform optimal multisensory combination. On the basis of this theory, we argue that multisensory integration is a dialogue between sensory modalities rather that the convergence of all sensory information onto a supra-modal area.},

In addition, we develop a novel approach, called BoostME, which uses the ME classifiers and the associated confidence scores in each boosting iteration. We evaluated these different methods using the TRECVID 2003 broadcast news data set. We found that SVM-based and ME-based techniques both outperformed the pure boosting techniques, with the SVM-based solutions achieving even slightly higher accuracy.

Decision fusion has been applied at the level of individual analysis time frames, phone segments and for isolated word recognition but in its basic form cannot be used for continuous speech recognition because of the combinatorial explosion of possible word string hypotheses that have to be evaluated.

We present a case for decision fusion at the utterance level and propose an algorithm that can be applied efficiently to continuous speech recognition tasks, which we call N-best decision fusion. The system was tested on a single-speaker, continuous digit recognition task where the audio stream was contaminated by additive multi-speaker babble noise.

The audioâvisual recognition system resulted in lower word error rates for all signal-to-noise conditions tested compared to the audio-alone system. The magnitude of the improvement was dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio.},

Research in psychology has shown that this exploration is fundamental for learning the names of objects and object categories. To address this problem in robotics, this paper presents a behavior-grounded approach that enables a robot to recognize the semantic labels of objects using its own behavioral interaction with them. To test this method, our robot interacted with 100 different objects grouped according to 20 different object categories. The robot performed 10 different behaviors on them, while using three sensory modalities (vision, proprioception and audio) to detect any perceptual changes. The results show that the robot was able to use multiple sensorimotor contexts in order to recognize a large number of object categories. Furthermore, the category recognition model presented in this paper was able to identify sensorimotor contexts that can be used to detect specific categories. Most importantly, the robotâs model was able to reduce exploration time by half by dynamically selecting which exploratory behavior should be applied next when classifying a novel object.},

	abstract = {The formation of categories, which constitutes the basis of developing concepts, requires multimodal information with a complex structure. We propose a model called the bag of multimodal hierarchical Dirichlet processes (BoMHDP), which enables robots to form a variety of multimodal categories. The BoMHDP model is a collection of a large number of MHDP models, each of which has a different set of weights for sensory information. The weights work to realize selective attention and enable the formation of various types of categories (e.g., object, haptic, and color). The BoMHDP model is an extension of the HDP, and categorization is unsupervised. However, categories that are not natural for humans are also formed. Therefore, only the significant categories are selected through interaction between the user and the robot. At the same time, words obtained during the interaction are connected to the categories. Finally, categories, which are represented by words, are selected. The BoMHDP model was implemented on a robot platform and a preliminary experiment was conducted to validate it. The results revealed that various categories can be formed with the BoMHDP model. We also analyzed the formed conceptual structure by using multidimensional scaling. The results indicate that the complex conceptual structure was represented reasonably well with the BoMHDP model.},
